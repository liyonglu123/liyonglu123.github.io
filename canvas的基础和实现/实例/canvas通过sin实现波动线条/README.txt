A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/egrucza/pen/WbmpqO.

 Working on a few different styles of sine waves. Utilizes sine-waves.js by Isaac Suttell.

*Update* I forked this pen and created a new version with the ability to toggle wave types. You can find it here http://codepen.io/egrucza/pen/raRGGR
